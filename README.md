# Base64-File-Converter

The application is an easy to use file converting tool that simply converts any file into Base64 format (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) as easily as it converts any Base64 string into bytes. Simply drag-and-drop file into application window and get converted one in the same folder.
